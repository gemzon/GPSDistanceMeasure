the plan is to - 

1. get the print and export functionality working on the results page.
2. sort change unit commands out.
3. I want to look at disabling/enabling the results tab depending on whether there is any result to view
4. enabling/disabling the 'Measure distance' button on the front page if there are no start or endpoints.
5. adding remove the capability to the end location list incase someone enters are the wrong result.
6. implementing import for JSON or CSV for start and end location created else were.
7. center the end locaiton list
8. fix the look of the output window so the list is spaced out and not all squashed on the left side
9. Refactor the XAML 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

possible directions ---

A. add map tab which displays the result on a map with customized pins
B. look at creating a mobile applation that incorporates the diatance measure calculator
C. create a web version of the applciation 
D. export the measurement calculator into a nuget package - will require extensive testing, documentation and support

comments:

- many great ideas..
- #6 import from JSON 1.0 ok, dialog design and structure subject to change during the project
- about D:
	- I don't know if readme points to the right references, can you complement your sources?
	- there are some constants that differ on various sites, earth/polar radius?
	- how do we get correct(!) test data? a long straight road!
