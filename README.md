#### GPSDistanceMeasure - Open Source

This application is designed to take in 2 GPS positions in degrees and then, work out the distance between them. The GPS Distance Measure makes use of 3 formulas *(links only meant as a start reference)* -

1. [Modified Pythagorean Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem)
2. [Great Circle](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GreatCircle.html)
3. [Haversine Formula](https://www.igismap.com/haversine-formula-calculate-geographic-distance-earth)

This application is open for modification.

We developed initial project live on stream <https://www.twitch.tv/copperbeardy> 5th October 2019.
